Order Fulfillment Lifecycle:

IBM Sterling includes all the activities from draft order to shipped order. 

An order document(contains information about the order like ordr id, address, payment information etc)
can be a sales order or service order. (sales order are for items ordered, service order is 
for services like repair, installation etc.) 

Different stages of Order Fulfillment Lifecycle are:

1. Draft order state: Orders are created through one of channels such as web, call center, or store.
					The Draft order is the first stage of the order until it is confirmed.
					An order can be modified until it is confirmed.
					
Example: A customer is shopping on an e-commerce website and adds a smartphone and accessories to their cart. 
They enter their shipping address and payment details but haven't clicked "Place Order" yet. 
The system treats this as a draft order, which can still be modified or canceled.


2. Created order state: After the order is confirmed, the order status moves to the Created state.
						The Distributed Order Management application picks up the order for fulfillment when 
						the order is in the Created status. At this stage, the order contains all the necessary
						information that is needed to process, such as the customer address, order lines 
						(containing items and the required quantity), and the payment information.
						
Example: Once the customer confirms their order for the smartphone and accessories, the order moves to the
		Created state. The system now knows the exact items to fulfill, the delivery address, and
		payment confirmation.


3. Scheduled state: The order moves to the Scheduled state once the system determines which fulfillment location
					(Node) has the required inventory or service capacity.
					The system applies scheduling rules (e.g., selecting the closest warehouse or store) to 
					assign inventory and set a delivery date.
					The delivery date is communicated to the customer. 
					After the delivery date is applied, the order marked as Scheduled.

Example: The system identifies that the smartphone is available at a warehouse in California and assigns the 
		inventory for fulfillment. The customer is informed that the expected delivery date is in 3 days.
		At this stage, the order is in the Scheduled state.

	
4. Released state: After the inventory assignment is finalized, the order is released to the fulfillment node 
					(e.g., a warehouse or store). The node may also handle additional services, like adding a
					gift wrap, kitting, or labeling.
					
Example: The system sends an instruction to the California warehouse to pick, pack, and prepare the smartphone
		for shipment. If the customer requested a gift wrap, the warehouse includes it at this stage. 
		The order is now in the Released state.

5. Send to node state: At this stage, the order release details are transmitted to the designated node. 
					This is often the formal communication step between the central OMS and the fulfillment center.
					

Example: The system sends a release document to the California warehouse system with specific instructions to 
		fulfill the order, including the shipment method and packaging requirements.


6. Shipped state: The order is shipped to the customer from a specific node. The Node that is selected for order 
				fulfillment creates the shipment for the order. Based on the mode of fulfillment - delivery,
				shipping, or pick up, the Node fulfills the order. After the order is shipped to the customer, 
				the order is marked as Shipped.


Example: The California warehouse ships the smartphone and accessories via a courier service like FedEx. 
		The tracking details are generated and shared with the customer. At this point, the order status is 
		updated to Shipped.
