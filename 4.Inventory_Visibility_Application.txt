Inventory Visibility Application:

The Inventory Visibility application is a system designed to give businesses a unified view of their inventory 
across multiple locations (Sites), organizations (Enterprises), and collaborators (Participants). 
This ensures inventory tracking and management are efficient and accurate, whether the inventory is at internal 
warehouses, retail stores, or external partner facilities like supplier warehouses or third-party logistics 
providers (Ship Nodes).

Example:
Business Context
A company, Global Retail Co., operates:

a. Multiple Sites: Warehouses in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago.
b. Enterprises: Two brands, one for electronics and another for furniture.
c. Participants: External suppliers and third-party logistics providers.

The company uses the Inventory Visibility application to:

a. Track inventory levels across all their locations, including supplier stock.
b. Manage demand and supply to ensure orders are fulfilled efficiently.
c. Quickly identify and resolve inventory shortages.

How It Works:

Real-Time Inventory Availability

1. The application synchronizes inventory data from:

a. Demand: Sales Orders, Reservations, Forecasts.
b. Supply: Stock on hand, In-transit inventory, Purchase Orders.

For instance:

A customer orders a laptop on the company's e-commerce site.
The application checks stock availability across all sites (e.g., New York Warehouse has 10 laptops, and a 
supplier has 20 ready to ship).
It immediately reflects the availability on the website, allowing the customer to place the order.


2. Identifying Shortages
If demand exceeds supply at a location, the system flags a shortage.

Example:

A customer places an order for 15 laptops, but the New York Warehouse has only 10.
The system detects a shortage of 5 laptops and notifies the inventory planner.
Resolving Shortages
The inventory planner can resolve the issue by:

3. Allocating Sales Orders:
Assigning the remaining 5 laptops to be fulfilled from the supplier stock.

4. Executing Purchase Orders:
Raising a new Purchase Order for 10 laptops from the supplier to replenish stock.

5. Moving Inventory:
Transferring 5 laptops from the Los Angeles Warehouse to the New York Warehouse.


Benefits to Global Retail Co.:

a. Real-Time Insights: The system provides an accurate view of inventory across all locations.
b. Efficient Operations: Inventory planners can quickly address shortages and balance stock.
c. Customer Satisfaction: Orders are fulfilled on time without unnecessary delays.
